### Build Configuration
- **Vite**: Configured for React with relative asset paths
- **Electron Builder**: Windows installer with proper resource handling
- **Single Instance Lock**: Prevents multiple app instances
- **Icon Management**: Proper handling of tray and taskbar icons

## Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start Vite development server
- `npm run electron`: Start Electron in development mode
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint

### Development Notes
- The app uses relative paths for assets in production builds
- Icons are properly packaged and accessible in both dev and production
- Single instance lock prevents multiple app launches
- Timer state is preserved across window operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Timer not starting**: Check TickSpot API credentials in settings
2. **Icons not showing**: Ensure icon files are in the `public/` directory
3. **Multiple instances**: The app enforces single instance - close existing instances first
4. **Taskbar overlay not updating**: Restart the app to refresh icon states

### API Issues
- Verify your TickSpot API token is valid
- Check your subscription ID is correct
- Ensure you have proper permissions for the projects/tasks
